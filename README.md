I'm a passionate software engineer with 20+ years in software industry.

I'm a specialist in clean code, refactoring techniques, object-oriented design, Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design and Clean/Hexagonal Architecture. All over the years, I've worked with several programming languages like Clarion, JavaScript, VB.NET, C#, TypeScript, Ruby, Elixir and Kotlin.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books and comic books, watching movies and Flamengo soccer matches and staying together with my children.

I write about software at [robsoncastilho.com.br](https://robsoncastilho.com.br).
